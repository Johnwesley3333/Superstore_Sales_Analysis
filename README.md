# ðŸ›’ Sales Analysis & Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview
The **Sales Analysis & Dashboard** project is an end-to-end analytics solution for retail sales data. It focuses on understanding sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and profitability, and presents the findings through an interactive dashboard.  

This project helps businesses make data-driven decisions, optimize product strategies, and forecast future sales.

## 2. Dataset Overview
- **Dataset Name:** Superstore Sales Dataset  
- **Source:** Public retail sales dataset (CSV format)  
- **Content:** Order ID, Product details, Sales, Profit, Discounts, Order Dates, Customer Region, etc.  
- **Size:** Approximately X rows and Y columns (replace with actual numbers)  

The dataset is used to perform analysis, visualize sales trends, and build predictive forecasts.

## 3. Project Workflow
The project follows an end-to-end workflow:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Handle missing values, convert dates, standardize column names, create calculated columns.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Examine trends, distributions, and relationships among sales, profit, discounts, and regions.  
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Prepare dataset aggregates and KPIs for visualization and forecasting.  
4. **Visualization & Dashboarding** â€“ Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard to filter data by product, region, and time.  
5. **Forecasting (Optional)** â€“ Use time-series models to predict future sales trends.  
6. **Insights & Reporting** â€“ Provide actionable insights and recommendations for business strategy.
